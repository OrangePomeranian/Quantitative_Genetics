# Assignment 1 
The first project, delves into Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) quality control (QC) using PLINK software. It encompasses SNP analysis on chromosome 15, minor allele frequency assessments, discordant sex information, genotyping failure rates, SNP missingness, outlying heterozygosity, relatedness between samples, PCA for ancestry determination, and QC criteria for SNP inclusion. This comprehensive study showcases the application of bioinformatics tools in genetic analysis, focusing on data handling, QC processes, and insights into population genetics.

# Assignment 2
The second project, further explores GWAS QC through PLINK, including detailed analyses like SNP and individual missingness, heterozygosity outliers, MAF calculations, relatedness checks, and ancestry determination via PCA. It highlights critical QC steps for GWAS, emphasizing data integrity and the implications of genetic diversity and ancestry in population studies.
